# Node HQ Trivia Bot Rewrite

 Due to HQ disabling people from accessing there Beaerer Token, and my old bot working not working on the newest version of Node.JS I decided to rewrite a majority of everything, and perhaps make it work with HQ Words. This bot is not completed, this allows you to watch the game in your browser at http://localhost but this feature is expermiental and probably going to be removed in the future.
 
 This bot is not very complex yet, but I do plan on changing a lot before I make the bot actualy answer questions. I do not plan on allowing this bot in games, nor should it touch anygames. /testing Is the folder that I parse games and send questions through the websocket, this way I am not interferring with real games.
  
 Remimber, Use this at your own discretion, I am doing this for fun, and educational reasons like the previous bot.
